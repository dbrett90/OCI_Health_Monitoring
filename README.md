# OCI Health & Monitoring Demo
This repository is built specifically for creating a customer-facing demo for OCI Health &amp; Monitoring Tools

## Overview
The OCI Health and Monitoring Demo will cover 5 specific tools native to the OCI Console. These include:
* Service Metrics
* Metrics Explorer
* Alarm Status
* Alarm Definitions
* Health Checks

Upon completion of the demo, users should have a deeper understanding of how they can leverage these Tools
to monitor their cloud infrastructure at a high level. For information regarding deeper & more expansive monitoring see the links for [Oracle CASB](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/casb-cloud/palug/toc.htm) & [Oracle Management Cloud](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/management-cloud/index.html).
